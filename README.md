Ludum Dare 28
=============

Code repository for the 28th installment of the Ludum Dare competition, with 'You only get one' as its theme

The game is developed in Haxe, using the OpenFL and HaxePunk libraries. Pixen is used for graphics and BFXR for its sound effects.

In this game you must try to stay on top by whacking the other players from the platform (platform, hill, potatoes, potatoes). Beware though, your kingdom can become quite small over time.
